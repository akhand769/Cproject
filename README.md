# Cproject
This is a tic tac toe game with a special feature that the player can play with the cpu. I have coded for the cpu logic also which will decide the next step to be moved in the game. 
The most impressive part of this game is the cpu logic where the code is written such that the computer will decide what will be the next move in order to win or make the user lose or draw the game.
This project is in c language but can be made with more functionalities using c++.
